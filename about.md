[**Click here for my CV in PDF format**]({{site.baseurl}}/CV Daniel Leslie Hall.pdf)

I'm a half-English, half-Australian scientist who spent most of his life growing up just outside of Rome, Italy. I come from a travelling family, and have studied in Italy, the UK, and the USA. I'm an inquisitive character, with an aptitude for operating and tinkering with machines of all kinds.

I found my way into research in experimental physics, specifically particle accelerators, because there are few places like it where you can oversee and operate large, complex machines (which often require customisation of some kind) to perform tasks that are specliased and advanced enough that one does not simply find the instructions to do so in a text-book - to be successful requires in-depth knowledge and creative use of the science and machines involved. I get a large amount of satisfaction from being able to use my equipment to solve a problem, while tinkering with it to squeeze out every last bit of performance I can get.

Science and technology are fields full of fascinating subjects and discoveries, and I greatly enjoy talking to people about them, whether it be to a specialist crowd or a general audience. Outside of my scientific pursuits and hobbies associated with them, I enjoy activities that centre around effortless freedom of movement, these being ballroom dance and ice skating, as well as a fascination with aviation.

Below you can find an extract from my complete CV, focussing on my education and work experience. If you would like to know more about the activities I have been involved in as part of my experiences, please check out my Projects page.

## Experience
---

**Graduate research assistant**, Cornell University
_Aug 2012 - Present_  
My Ph.D. studies have focussed on the research and development of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn as a next-generation superconductor for use in superconducting radio-frequency accelerator cavities; in particular, understanding the mechanisms that limit the quality factor and quench field of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn cavities fabricated using the vapour diffusion process. Beyond this focus, projects I have worked on during my time at Cornell University include:
- RF cavity commissioning and testing using the cavity commissioning facilities at Cornell University,
- Upgrading, maintaining, and operating the UHV coating furnace for the production of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn, including the development and implementation of a new control system,
- The design and development, in collaboration with a team of engineers, of a new high-speed temperature mapping system for cavity testing,
- Detecting the presence of higher-order modes in the Energy Recovery Linac 7-cell cryomodule using beam-based methods,
- The design, fabrication and operation of a high-field sample host cavity with an associated temperature mapping system for characterising novel RF superconductors.

During my time at Cornell I have also been responsible for the training of new graduate students, as well as having served as a mentor to a number of undergraduate research assistants.

**M.Sc. research student**, University of Manchester  
_Sep 2011 - Aug 2012_  
As a masters graduate student I was a member of the High Energy Physics group, and part of the SuperNEMO collaboration searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay. My work was primarily focussed on understanding the Geiger trackers in the demonstrator module for the SuperNEMO experiment. I developed a Monte Carlo simulation using ROOT and GEANT4 to model the tracker's response and the readout from the electronics of the module. This simulation was used to evaluate the demonstrator module's performance and capabilities.

**M.Phys. research student**, University of Manchester  
_Sep 2010 - June 2011_  
During my M.Phys. research internships, I was involved with two groups in the physics department. As part of the Nuclear Physics group, I worked on improving a computational method for searching large amounts of data obtained from triple coincidence gamma-ray spectroscopy, looking for tell-tale signs of known (and unknown) decay paths. Later, as part of the Accelerator Physics group, I was involved in the study and simulation of higher-order modes in the then-experimental Third Harmonic cavities in use on the FLASH fast electron laser at DESY.  

**Undergraduate research assistant**, UC Santa Barbara  
_June - Sep 2010_  
Working as an assistant in the Neutron Multiplicity Detector Group, under the supervision of Prof. Harry Nelson, I analysed the early data from the high energy neutron detector installed at the Soudan mine in Minnesota, and was also involved in the development of the analysis code to discern high energy neutron events in the detector.
