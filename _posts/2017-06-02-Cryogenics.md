Superconducting RF wouldn't be superconducting without copious amounts of liquid helium. Throughout my time at Cornell, I've handled thousands of litres of helium when commissioning cavities. As a finite resource, we re-liquefy the boil-off gas for use another day.

## Recovery and liquefaction

Handling helium is not an easy process. The liquid is very cold - 4.2 Kelvin (-269 C), although lower temperatures are achieved through vacuum pumping - and transfers are a delicate process. Comissioning a superconducting RF cavity requires cooling it to temperatures below its transition temperature, with the standard range being 1.6 to 4.2 Kelvin. The dewar in which the cavity is housed is filled with liquid helium, in quantities between 300 to 3000 litres, depending on the size of the dewar.

Helium that is boiled off in the process of keeping the cavity cold expands in volume roughly 200 times when going to room temperature. To prevent dangerous over-pressuring of the containment vessel, and to recover the helium, a compressor is used to move the gaseous helium into an outside storage tank. Here it is kept until a second compressor moves it into the liquefier, which uses the room temperature, high pressure helium to work a series of pistons. In doing this work, the helium cools down considerably, to about 5 or 6 Kelvin. Passing the helium through a Joule-Thompson valve performs the last step in the process of liquefying the helium and storing it in a dewar at 4.2 Kelvin, where it can be used again.

The helium circuit at Newman laboratory is comprised of 3 compressors, a liquefier, 3 high pressure gas storage tanks, and a 3000 litre liquid storage dewar. In my time at Cornell, I have operated the system for many hours, often being responsible for its operation after-hours and on weekends.
