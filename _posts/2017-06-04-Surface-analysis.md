Superconducting cavities are often many centimetres long and wide, with a suface area on the order of a square metre or more - yet the surface must be perfect to the scale of nanometres. This is because the length scales over which superconductivity is sensitive to defects are on the order of 10 to 50 nanometres, and surface imperfections of that size order can mean the difference between a high-efficiency cost saver and a piece of junk. Furthermore, while the cavities are made of material 3 millimetres thick, due to the nature of RF superconductivity only the top 500 nanometres matter. To understand the performance of a superconductor, it is therfore necessary to resolve features at the micro-scale.

At Cornell we are fortunate to have the Cornell Centre for Materials Research, which offers the use of a number of material analysis machines. Amongst these are two scanning electrom microscopes (SEMs), both equipped with a number of features. During my time at Cornell, I have spent many hours of the SEMs analysing the topography and composition of thin film superconducting samples, searching for surface defects and looking for clues as to how the material grew and will perform. Using tools such as Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Electron Backscatter Diffraction, and conventional secondary electron and backscatter imaging, we are able to extract a considerable amount of information regarding the nature of the superconductor.
