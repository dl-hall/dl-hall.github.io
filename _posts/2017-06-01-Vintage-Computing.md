There's something strangely comforting and cosy about monitoring a webserver or playing Zork on the soft green glow of a VT220. I make a hobby out of collecting old (pre-2000, the closer to the 1980s the better) computers and terminals. Aside from how cool they look, they make for fantastic tinkering; the systems are still simple enough, and the schematics still around, so that repairs and modifications can be done with discrete components and a soldering iron.

## Terminals

I own a few terminals - 2 DEC VT220s, 3 Zenith Datasystems Z-19s, and 1 Wyse-85. The last one is actively used to manage the linux machine on which this webpage is developed. Duplicates are always handy as in the worst case I can always cannibalise one to keep another alive. The VT220s are in good working condition, aside from some of the caps being a little old. The Z-19s all suffered from vertical foldover when I got them, but I fixed that; however, 2 of them have developed some reference voltage issues in the vertical signal generation circuit that I'm currently in the process of fixing. Turns out, I have Z-19-CNs, and the schematics are no longer available - however, Zenith were kind enough to patent the technology that the vido board used, and the schematics are available (in separate sections) in the patents, which can be found on Google.

## Computers

My computer collection started with a simple purpose - one it still fulfills. Scientists are notoriously bad at keeping code up to date (not that you can blame them - it's not their job). As such, many scientific codes are compiled for only one or two architectures. During my Masters, I found that a particular code I had to run would only run on an i386, 32-bit linux computer. It took a little wrangling to find one, and it made me think that I should really keep a backup collection for running old software. My collection has since expanded to Windows XP, Windows 95, Mac OS 7 dedicated machines, as well as a DEC VAXstation 4000/90 - although that last one is more for fun than anything else.
