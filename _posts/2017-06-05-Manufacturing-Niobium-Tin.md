Niobium-Tin (commonly written Nb3Sn) is an intermetallic alloy of niobium and tin, and is a Type II superconductor with a transition temperature of 18 Kelvin. It's widely to be considered the next generation of material for use in superconducting magnets, but is also very promising for use in superconducting RF cavities. For magnets, Niobium-Tin is often produced in the presence of copper, allowing production at lower temperatures; however, for superconducting cavities, the presence of copper is unacceptable. Manufacturing is therefore done using a vapour diffusion process directly into niobium.

The vapour diffusion process consist of starting with a substrate of niobium, and bringing it in contact with tin gas at the correct temperature to form Niobium-Tin. This is done is a specially built ultra-high-vacuum furnace, in which both the evaporation rate of the tin and the temperature of the niobium substrate can be carefully controlled. The advantage of this process is that it allows us to machine the part out of niobium, bypassing Niobium-Tin's issues with being brittle, and form only a thin film of the alloy on the surface, resolving the issue of the alloy's low thermal conductivity.

At Cornell we have built such a furnace, large enough to produce single-cell superconducting cavities. The performance of these cavities, in terms of efficiency, has surpassed even the state-of-the-art of niobium. For the last 3 years, I have been responsible for the manufacturing of Niobium-Tin samples and cavities, operating, maintaining and upgrading the furnace. This has included developing new diagnostics for determining the evaporation rate of the tin and the amount of tin remaining for use - a metric that was previously not known until after the coating had finished and the furnace opened - and upgrading the diagnostics suite with high speed monitoring of the furnace's health. The furnace is controlled remotely, using a GUI developed in MatLab that is even capable of alerting the user via text message should an issue arise with the coating.
