Radio-frequency (RF) cavities are the primary means of acclerating particles - be they protons, electrons, or ions - beyond the means achievable by the electron gun or the cyclotron. They operate by establishing an electromagnetic field inside them, which creates a high voltage along the length of the structure that oscillates many billion times a second. By correctly timing the passage of the particles through the cavity, they will be accelerated. At Newman laboratory we are fully equipped to produce, prepare and commission superconducting RF cavities for use in an accelerator.

RF cavities are high precision structures, requiring machining precision to the fraction of the millimetre and high surface uniformity and cleanliness to perform to the specifications demanded of them. Although great care is taken at every step in the process to producing a cavity, the nature of the device is so delicate performance cannot simply be guaranteed; it must be carefully measured before the cavity can be cleared for use.

Testing an RF cavity consists largely of establishing its efficiency at different values of the operating gradient, the voltage that accelerates the particles. In the case of superconducting cavities, this requires testing them in a dewar filled with liquid helium to establish superconductivity. Numerous diagnostics systems are available to determine the efficiency of the cavity, including detecting the presence of field emission and regions of local heating on the surface of the cavity through the use of temperature mapping methods. The ultimate limits of the cavities can be stress-tested using our Boeing 2 MW klystron, which is critical in understanding the ultimate gradient at which the cavities can operate.

As a research and development facility, our testing setup is highly modular, allowing quick changes and modifications to accomodate the needs of state-of-the-art cavities. The operation of the complete system is highly complex, akin to flying a small jet aircraft, and requiring a couple of years of supervised training to operate effectively. During my time at Cornell, I have made significant contributions to the capabilities of the RF testing system, and have also been responsible for training new graduate students in the use of the system.
