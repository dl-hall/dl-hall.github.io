In 2007 I joined a Ballroom dance class and I've been at it since then. I enjoy the freedom of movement, moving to the music, and sharing the experience with old friends and new acquaintances met on the dance floor. A couple of years ago I saw someone Ballroom dance on ice skates, and discovered the world of Ice Dancing, which has lead me to take up skating and take my dancing ability onto the ice.

Ballroom dancing, in the sense laid out by the Imperial Society of the Teacher's of Dance, consists of the International Standard and Latin, and American Smooth and Rhythym styles. I've tried my hand at all of them, but being tall and British I specialise in International Standard: Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Quickstep, and the Viennese Waltz. I've taught dance to both social clubs and to the competitive dance team at Cornell, and greatly enjoy seeing people dance for the first time and watch them realise they can do it - and that it's fun!
