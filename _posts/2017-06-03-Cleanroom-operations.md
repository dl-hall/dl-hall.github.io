Superconducting RF cavities must be assembled in extremely clean conditions, as the high voltages that they experience during operation are more than capable of tearing the electrons from any dust particles inside the cavity, in a phenomenon called Field Emission. These unwelcome electrons are then accelerated by the cavity, drawing power that might otherwise be used for actual beam acceleration. They then go on to cause all sorts of problems, including slamming into the walls of the accelerator and producing hazardous radiation. Thus, cavities must be handled in the controlled environment of a cleanroom.

## Cleanroom cavity assembly

At Newman laboratory, we are equipped with a cleanroom that achieves Class 10 and 100 (ISO 4 and 5), depending on the station. This provides an environment in which highly sensitive components, such as cavity commissioning inserts, cavity cryomodules, and high voltage electron guns can be assembled. It also houses the custom-built coating furnace for the production of Niobium-Tin (Nb3Sn) cavities and components, for which I am responsible.

The cleanroom has everything we need, cleaned and housed to the requirements of the environment, including tools, cleaning agents and equipment, and a computer. All items must be carefully cleaned before being introduced to the cleanroom through a special staging chamber. For ease of use, much of the equipment inside the cleanroom can also be controlled from outside.

The cleanroom is a crucial component of the RF cavity commissioning workflow; the cavity, once ready for commissioning, is brought into the cleanroom where it is cleaned and assembled into the supporting equipment. It is then carefully pumped down to vacuum using a special ultra-clean pumpdown system. Once this is done, the system is checked for any potential leaks and then removed from the cleanroom for use.
