I love talking about science and technology (and particularly the intersection between the two, i.e. the technology that serves science), and during my university career I've been involved in a number of outreach opportunities. During my undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester I was the president of the Manchester Physics Society (PhysSoc), and after joining the graduate programme at Cornell I got involved with student mentoring and outreach activities at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) Xploration station.

## Mentoring and outreach

Getting people excited about science, particularly in how it can be of benefit to society in both the short and long term, is (in my opinion) a crucial part of being a scientist. I've given talks to both general audiences and specialists on the importance of particle accelerators in industry and science, and have been a mentor to many undergraduates, both from Cornell and from other institutions across the country as part of outreach programmes. Growing up I was very fortunate to benefit from the instruction of excellent teachers who successfully transmitted to me a fascination and excitement for how science can be used to improve people's lives, and I hope that in some way I have managed to pass that same passion on to the students I have interacted with.
